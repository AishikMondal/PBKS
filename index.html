   <strong> <h2><u>Chris Gayle</u></h2></strong>
    <p><em>
      Universe Boss’ Chris Gayle is the darling of the masses. There is no better entertainer than Gayle both on and off the field. After conquering the Bangalore crowds for RCB, Gayle made a quiet move to Punjab Kings in 2018 and made an instant impact with another strong season that included a century against Sunrisers Hyderabad. The Gayle-Rahul combination is one of the most lethal in the tournament and the bowling sides have often struggled to contain the two as the left-right pair goes about their demolition job.<br>

<strong>Gayle had a fine season in 2019 where he was on the verge of getting his 7th IPL century but remained unbeaten on 99. He struck 4 half-centuries and scored a total of 490 runs from 319 balls that he faced. The lefthander had a similar outing in the 2020 season as he was dismissed once again for 99 and missed out on a century. Although he added nearly 300 runs in the 7 games that he played as an opener. Stay alert as there’s a “Gaylestorm”.</strong>

         <strong> <h2><u>KL Rahul</u></h2></strong>
    <p>The fans of Punjab Kings will pin their hopes on this man as the team looks to win their maiden title. It is KL Rahul, who holds the key to their fortunes.<br>

A fresh combination ahead of a new season augurs well for the team and Rahul, who has been in excellent form. <strong>He knows this side well, being one of the revelations of IPL 2018 as he led the PBKS run charts with over 650 runs with six half-centuries that included a few innings in the 90s. Together with Chris Gayle, Rahul formed a potent opening combination that took the attack to the opposition and he enjoyed the freedom given to him at the top of the batting order. He had a superb 2019 season, where he even got his maiden IPL ton and finished the season with an impressive average of 53.90. 2020 was a massive season for the Punjab skipper as he won the orange cap, scoring 670 runs at an average of 55.83. Add to that, his knock of 132* against the Royal Challengers became the highest individual score by an Indian batsman in the IPL.</strong> </p>

      <img src="MDS.jpg" alt="" width="300px"/>
         <strong> <h2><u>MD Shami</u></h2></strong>
    <p><em>Mohammed Shami has revived his limited-overs career with some stellar performances in India colours in recent months and was picked up by Punjab Kings for a hefty price tag of INR 4.8 crore. Shami will be leading the PBKS pace attack and his experience will be vital. He has the skills to be effective both at the start of the innings and also in the death overs. Shami’s progress has been terrific and he is now a complete bowler and batsmen will need to be wary against him. <strong>He had a fine run in 2019 and finished the season as KXIP’s highest wicket-taker with 19 wickets from 14 games. His bowling got even better in the 2020 season where he defended six runs in a super-over through his incredible consistency and struck early with the new ball for PBKS throughout the 13th edition.</strong></em> </p>

      <strong><h2><u>Gleen Maxwell</u></h2></strong>
      <p>
        
        A player who has built a reputation for his explosive batting, nonchalantly clearing the boundaries even in some of the biggest stadiums in the world. Explosive with the bat, tidy with the ball and a live wire on the field, Maxwell has all the traits of a top-level red ball cricketer. He was KXIP’s leading run scorer and helped them get to a final in 2014. Now in his second homecoming for a familiar team and familiar venue, Maxi would hope to continue from where he left off.
        <strong> <br>
        Maxwell had a standout season for the Kings XI Punjab (KXIP) in 2014 where he amassed 552 runs at an average of 34.50 and an impressive strike rate of 187.75.
